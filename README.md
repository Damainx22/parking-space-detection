# Parking Space Detection

This is a team project to build an end-to-end machine learning system for detecting parking space occupancy and vehicle types (car, bike, truck) from images.

The long-term goal is to:
- Train a computer vision model to classify parking spaces as empty or occupied
- Detect and classify vehicle types
- Expose the model through an API
- Build a frontend dashboard showing occupancy statistics and trends
- Deploy the full system

This repository is currently under active development.

## Current Status

- Data processing pipeline: implemented
- Training scripts: implemented
- Inference script: implemented
- API: not yet started
- Frontend dashboard: not yet started
- Deployment: not yet started

## Getting Started

See `QUICKSTART.md` for instructions on:
- Installing dependencies
- Downloading and processing the dataset
- Training the model
- Running inference

## Contributing

Each team member should:
- Work on a feature branch
- Open a pull request into `main`
- Avoid committing large datasets or model weights
